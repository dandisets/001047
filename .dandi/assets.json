"Subject 1: 011C_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 5 times at 1Hz frequency. Subject 2: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011C_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 5 times at 1Hz frequency. Subject 2: 011CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Stained with FITC. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011C_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 1 time. Stained with DAPI. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Subject 2: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011C_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 1 time. Stained with Cy3. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011Control_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP).

"Subject 1: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels).

"Subject 1: 011Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject 1: 013C_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. Subject 2: 011C_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 3 times at 1Hz frequency. Stained with DAPI. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg).

"Subject 1: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg).

Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR).

Subject 2: 013Control_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Subject 2: 013C_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. Stained with DAPI. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Subject 2: 013C_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. Stained with FITC. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Subject 2: 011CC_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Subject 2: 013Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI.

Subject 2: 013C_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 5 times at 1Hz frequency. Stained with Cy3. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Subject 2: 013Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI.

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3.

Subject 2: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP).

"Subject 1: 013Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",
