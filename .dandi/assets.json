"Subject 1: 011C_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 5 times at 1Hz frequency. Subject 2: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011Control_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013Control_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject: 013Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",
