"Subject 1: 011C_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, repeated 5 times at 1Hz frequency. Subject 2: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011CC_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011Control_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 011Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013Control_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013CC_x2: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 011CC_x3: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: DAPI. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: Cy3. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject 1: 013Control_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Subject 2: 013CC_x1: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Each image contains 2 exposure areas. Subject 1 is on the left side of the image, and subject 2 is on the right side of the image. Each exposure area protocols are described in Subject 1 and 2 descriptions, and the overall protocol description is given below.Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Subject: 013Control_x5: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, Unknown protocol type, Unknown repetitions. Channel used: FITC. Experiments were conducted using a four stainless steel electrode setup. The distance between adjacent electrodes was 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol consisted of packets of pulses delivered from four electrodes (channels). The first pulse (600 ns) in each packet was delivered from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1) at a 3.2 kV amplitude. Subsequent pulses (600 ns) were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (electrodes 2 and 4) at 75% of the first pulse's amplitude. The same amplitude pulses were then applied from electrodes 1 and 3. Following this, 50% amplitude pulses were applied from electrodes 2 and 4, followed by the same amplitude pulses from electrodes 1 and 3. The final round of pulses from each electrode pair was at 25% of the first pulse's amplitude. After one packet was applied, it was repeated nine times at a defined frequency rate. Upon completion of the protocol, it was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or switched to another starting active electrode (e.g., electrode 2). Sequences were repeated in the same manner until all four electrodes acted as active electrodes.Control protocols were applied in the same manner, frequencies, and repetitions as the CanCan protocols, but without the subsequent CanCan pulses from two electrodes.Before exposure, the growth media was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). The cell-permeable Hoechst dye labeled the nuclei of all cells (detected using the DAPI channel). YP, which has limited permeability into intact cells, was used as a semi-quantitative marker of plasma membrane permeabilization by electroporation (detected using the FITC channel). Thirty minutes post-exposure, the media containing dyes was replaced with physiological solution without dyes. The cell monolayer was then scanned for YP uptake. Two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added to the media, incubated for 15 minutes, and then removed by changing the media to one without PI. PI was used to evaluate dead cells after electric pulses (detected using the Cy3 channel). Microscope: Unknown. Detector: Unknown. Objective: Unknown. Channels: .",

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_B2, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, control protocol (no canceling pulses applied), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_B2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, control protocol (no canceling pulses applied), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_B3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_B4, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 011: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_B5, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 011: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_B6, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_C2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, control protocol (no canceling pulses applied), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_C3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 011: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_C4, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240814_C5, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, control protocol (no canceling pulses applied), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_B2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 011: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_B3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_B4, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, control protocol (no canceling pulses applied), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_B5, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, control protocol (no canceling pulses applied), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_B6, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_C3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 011: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_C4, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 013: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240814_C5, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure). 011: 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses), repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.
